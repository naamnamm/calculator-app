## Summary

This application allows me to deepen my skill further in Javascript. I learn to use a lot of if statements to work through complicated logic, break problems into chucks and solve it step by step. And I've realized that problem solving skill and the attitude towards problems are so important because as a developer, I will always run into problems in every step of the way. 

This project was really challenging but I have learn so much and still enjoying to build more applications. :)
